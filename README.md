# Dr-House-Finance_Loan-Default-PredictorAI
Loan default prediction models can help banks to minimize financial risks and losses by identifying potential loan defaulters in advance. This enables banks to take proactive measures, such as adjusting interest rates or declining the loan application, to avoid granting loans to high-risk individuals. Such models can also help banks to optimize their loan approval process, reduce the processing time, and improve customer satisfaction by providing faster loan approvals to low-risk customers.
